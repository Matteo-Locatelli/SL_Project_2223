Before diving into the analysis, some pre-processing operations were performed on the dataset.

\subsection{Data cleaning}
The initial step involved data cleaning, as it was crucial to remove any duplicated samples and reconcile any inconsistent data.
After running this step, the number of samples left is 1278.

\subsection{Variable selection}
After reviewing the dataset, we identified some columns that were not relevant for our analysis. Specifically, we removed the ``Name'' column as it only contained the players' names and did not provide any useful information for our purposes. Additionally, we removed the ``REB'' column because it was redundant, as it can be calculated by summing the ``OREB and ``DREB'' columns.

All the presented analysis are intended to be on the cleaned dataset.
