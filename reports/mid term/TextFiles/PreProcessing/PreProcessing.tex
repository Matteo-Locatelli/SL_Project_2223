Before diving into the analysis, some pre-processing operations were performed on the dataset.

\subsection{Data cleaning}
The first operation was data cleaning. This was necessary since there were duplicated samples and also inconsistent data.
After running this step, the number of samples left is 1278.

\subsection{Columns cancellation}
From an overview of the dataset we cancelled some columns that were not useful for the analysis.
The first one is the \textit{"name"} column that is useless for our purposes, since it just contains the players' name.
The second one is \textit{"reb"}, the reason in this case is that \textit{"reb"} is given by the sum of \textit{"oreb"} and \textit{"dreb"}, there is a redundancy then and we decided to avoid it.
 
\noindent
All the analysis presented are intended to be on the clean dataset.
