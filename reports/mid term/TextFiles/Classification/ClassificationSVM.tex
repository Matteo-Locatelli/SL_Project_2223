\subsection{Support vector machines}

As a last method, we tried applying the support vector machine (SVM) technique, with three different kernel function, in combination with cross-validation to see if we can achieve better performances:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Linear, with an accuracy of $68.75\%$;
	\item Polynomial, with an accuracy of $67.8\%$;
	\item Radial, with an accuracy of $67.5\%$.
\end{itemize} 

The SVM technique did not improve the classification performances in this case.
