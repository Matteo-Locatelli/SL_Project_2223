\subsection{Support vector machines}

As a last method, we tried applying the support vector machine (SVM) technique, with three different kernel function, in combination with cross-validation to see if we can achieve better performances. The results are displayed in \Tab~\ref{table:SVMkernels}.

Unfortunately, even the SVM technique did not improve the classification performances in this case.

	\begin{tabular}{|| l | r ||} 
		\hline
		Kernel & Accuracy \\

		\hline
		Linear & $68.75\%$ \\
		\hline
		Polynomial & $67.81\%$ \\
		\hline
		Radial & $67.50\%$ \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
