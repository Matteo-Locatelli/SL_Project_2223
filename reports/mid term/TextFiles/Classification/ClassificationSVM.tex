\subsection{Support vector machines}

As a last method, we tried applying the support vector machine (SVM) technique, with three different kernel function, in combination with cross-validation to see if we can achieve better performances:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Linear (best cost = 0.01 -> best performance: 0.2765), with an accuracy of $68.75\%$;
	\item Polynomial (best cost = 1 \& degree = 1 -> best performance: 0.2724), with an accuracy of $67.81\%$;
	\item Radial (best cost = 1 \& gamma = 0.5 -> best performance: 0.2976), with an accuracy of $67.50\%$.
\end{itemize} 

The SVM technique did not improve the classification performances in this case.
