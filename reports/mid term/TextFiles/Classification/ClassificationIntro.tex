In this section we try to find a model able to explain the categorical variable ``TARGET\_5Yrs''.
In particular we are going to use:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Logistic regression;
	\item Classification trees with ensemble methods;
	\item K-nearest neighbors;
	\item Support vector machines.
\end{itemize}

Before diving into the analysis, we removed an additional column from the dataset, ``PTS'', which is a linear combination of ``FGM'', ``3P MADE'' and ``FTM''.

Therefore the dataset that will be used contains 1278 samples and 18 features.
