\subsection{Conclusions}

Based on the previous analysis, it was discovered that the variable ``GP'' holds significant importance in explaining the target variable, while the variable ``PTS'' does not have the expected level of significance. 
However, it is not sufficient by itself to achieve a high level of classification performance.

Indeed, as shown in \Tab~\ref{table:ClasEvalParams}, all the classification methods employed were able to obtain an accuracy around $70\%$. This suggests that there might be other influential factors, not captured by the existing features, that have a substantial impact on determining whether a player will have a lengthy career or not. Thus, it appears that the dataset itself poses a limitation in achieving high performance.
