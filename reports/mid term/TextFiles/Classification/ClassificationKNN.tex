\subsection{K-nearest neighbors}

As a last method, we tried applying the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm, with k=3, to see if we can achieve better performances. The resulted accuracy is $66.25\%$. Therefore, it seems like the kNN algorithm did not improve the classification performances in this case.
