\subsection{k-Nearest Neighbour}

As a last method, we tried applying the KNN (\textit{"k-Nearest Neighbour"}) algorithm, with K=3, to see if we can achieve better performances. The resulted accuracy is $66.25\%$. Therefore, it seems like the KNN algorithm did not improve the classification performances in this case.
