\subsection{Classification trees}

The following section has the purpose to use tree-based classification methods to find a model which will predict if an NBA's rookie career will be longer than five years.

We started to analyze the data through classification trees using the \textit{gini} minimization function. The result is a complex tree which is difficult to read (144 terminal nodes).

To understand whether it was better to use a simpler tree or not, we performed cross-validation using different levels of tree size and evaluated the impact on the test error.

\Fig~\ref{fig:tree_cv_plot} shows the trends of the deviance and the penalization factor \textit{k} for different values of tree size as determined by cross-validation. In \Fig~\ref{fig:trees_size} are shown the obtained trees with different sizes.

After the evaluation of the misclassification error rate on both train and test dataset, we concluded that the best model is the one with $size = 4$.

\todo{QUALI RISULTATI RIPROTARE?}
Residual Mean Deviance and Misclassification Error rate (train) -> test error rate
\begin{itemize}
	\item 4: 1.153 \& 0.3038 -> 0.3000
	\item 6: 1.114 \& 0.2996 -> 0.33125
	\item 7: 1.098 \& 0.2996 -> 0.33125
	\item 2: 1.200 \& 0.3424 -> 0.33125
\end{itemize}

However, all the trees do the first split on the variable ``GP'', suggesting that it is the most important variable.
