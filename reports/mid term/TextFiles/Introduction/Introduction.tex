The aim of this project is to analyze a dataset collected from NBA Rookies' games. This set contains 1340 samples, each one described by the 21 features listed in table \ref{tab:1}.
\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{||c | c ||} 
		\hline
		& Description\\
		Name & Player's name\\ 
		GP & Games Played\\ 
		MIN & Minutes played\\ 
		PTS & Points per Game\\
		FGM & Field Goals Made\\
		FGA & Field Goals Attempts\\
		FG\% & Field Goals Percent\\
		X3P\_Made & 3 Point Made\\
		X3PA & 3 Point Attempts\\
		X3P\% & 3 Point Percent\\
		FTM & Free Throw Made\\

		FT\% & Free Throw Percent\\

The main goal of this analysis is to obtain two models to explain the features \textit{PTS} and \textit{TARGET\_5YRS}. Clearly these are two different tasks by the nature of those two variables; in the first case there is a continuous variable, that means regression methods must be applied, in the second case the variable is binary, that leads to the application of classification methods.
