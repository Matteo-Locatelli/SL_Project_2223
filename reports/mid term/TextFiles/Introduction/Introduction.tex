The aim of this project is to analyze a dataset collected from NBA Rookies' games. This set contains 1340 samples, each one described by the 21 features listed below: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Name of the player (Name): string;
	\item Number of games played (GP): discrete variable;
	\item Minutes played per game (MIN): continuous variable;
	\item Points scored per game (PTS): continuous variable;
	\item Field goals made per game (FGM): continuous variable;
	\item Field goals attempts per game (FGA): continuous variable;
	\item Field goals percent per game (FG\%): continuous variable;
	\item Three point shots made per game (3P MADE): continuous variable;
	\item Three points shots attempts per game (3PA): continuous variable;
	\item Three point shots attempts per game (3P\%): continuous variable;
	\item Free throws made per game (FTM): continuous variable;
	\item Free throws attempts per game (FTA): continuous variable;
	\item Free throws made per game (FT\%): continuous variable;
	\item Number of offensive rebounds per game (OREB): continuous variable;
	\item Number of defensive rebounds per game (DREB): continuous variable;
	\item Number of rebounds per game (REB): continuous variable;
	\item Number of assists per game (AST): continuous variable;
	\item Number of steals per game (STL): continuous variable;
	\item Number of blocks per game (BLK): continuous variable;
	\item Number of turnovers per game (TOV): continuous variable;
	\item Output variable (TARGET\_5Yrs): 1 if career duration $\geq 5$, 0 otherwise\\
\end{itemize} 

%Besides ``Name, ``GP'' and ``TARGET\_5Yrs'', each feature is intended to be expressed ``per game''.
The objective of this analysis is to develop two distinct models that can effectively explain the features ``PTS'' and ``TARGET\_5Yrs''. Due to the nature of these variables, two different approaches are required. For ``PTS'', a regression method must be utilized due to its continuous nature, whereas for ``TARGET\_5Yrs'', a classification method must be employed given that it is a binary variable.
