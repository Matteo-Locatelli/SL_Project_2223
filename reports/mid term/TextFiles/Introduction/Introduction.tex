The aim of this project is to analyze a dataset collected from NBA Rookies' games. This set contains 1340 samples, each one described by the 21 features listed in table \ref{tab:1}. 
\begin{table}[h]

	\begin{tabular}{||c | c ||}
		\hline
		& Description\\
		\hline
		NAME & Player's name\\ 
		GP & Games Played\\ 
		MIN & Minutes played\\ 
		PTS & Points\\
		FGM & Field Goals Made\\
		FGA & Field Goals Attempts\\
		FG\% & Field Goals Percent\\
		X3P\_MADE & 3 Point Made\\
		X3PA & 3 Point Attempts\\
		X3P\% & 3 Point Percent\\
		FTM & Free Throw Made\\

		FT\% & Free Throw Percent\\
		OREB & Offensive Rebounds\\
		DREB & Defensive Rebounds\\
		REB & Rebounds\\
		AST & Assists\\
		STL & Steals\\
		BLK & Blocks\\

\end{table} 

Besides ``NAME, ``GP'' and ``TARGET\_5YRS'', each feature is intended to be expressed ``per game''.

The objective of this analysis is to develop two distinct models that can effectively explain the features ``PTS'' and ``TARGET\_5YRS''. Due to the nature of these variables, two different approaches are required. For ``PTS'', a regression method must be utilized due to its continuous nature, whereas for ``TARGET\_5YRS'', a classification method must be employed given that it is a binary variable.
