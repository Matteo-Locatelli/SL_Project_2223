\subsection{Lasso regression}

Our last selection method is the lasso regression. In \Fig~\ref{fig:LassoCoefVsLambda} is shown the coefficients' behavior as $\lambda$ increases.

\end{figure}

The same procedure followed for the ridge is applied again. In \Fig~\ref{fig:LassoCvPlot} it is possible the trend of the cross validated MSE when $\lambda$ increases. The optimal value was found to be $\lambda_{opt} = 0$, that means no penalization. The result is coherent with what obtained from Ridge Regression.

From our analysis, it appears that penalization is not helpful in improving the model's performance for our specific use case.
