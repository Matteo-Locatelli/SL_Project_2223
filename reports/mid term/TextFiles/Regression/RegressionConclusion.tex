Based on the model presented in \Tab~\ref{table:ForwardFinalModelSummary}, we can determine that the primary factors that impact a player's scoring ability include the following: minutes played (``MIN''), free throws made (``FTM''), turnovers (``TOV''), assists (``AST''), field goal percentage (``FG\%''), defensive rebounds (``DREB''), three-point percentage (``3P\%''), offensive rebounds (``OREB''), steals (``STL''), and three-point attempts (``3PA'').
Surprisingly, the factor ``GP'' (games played) is not included among these influencing factors.
