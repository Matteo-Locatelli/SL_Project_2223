The dataset is used for classification on the variable "target_5yrs".

To compute the linear regression and the shrinkage methods, the output 
variable must be a numeric one.

This section of the project uses the dataset without the classification
output variable "target_5yrs" and tries to explain a fictitious output
variable using all the other regressors:
-> "pts", average of points scored per game.

The choice of this fictitious output variable was done after considering
the fact that a NBA team would buy a player mostly considering number of 
points he scores per game.

Also, the other regressors could have ah higher possibility to explain it.
