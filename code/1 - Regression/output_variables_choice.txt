The dataset is used for classification on the variable "target_5yrs".

To compute the linear regression and the shrinkage methods, the output 
variable must be a numeric one.

This section of the project uses the dataset without the classification
output variable "target_5yrs" and tries to explain two other output
variables one at the time using all the other regressors:
- "min", average of minutes played per game;
- "pts", average of points scored per game.

The choice of this fictitious output variables was done after 
evaluating that the other regressors could have had ah higher possibility
to explain them.
