The dataset is used for classification on the variable "target_5yrs".

In this part of the project Support Vector Machine and Classifier will be used.

This section of the project uses the dataset without the variables "pts" 
and "reb" because of the previous discovery of linearly independent features 
in the dataset.

Cross-validation will be performed using the SVM method with three different 
kernel functions:
- linear
- polynomial
- radial
